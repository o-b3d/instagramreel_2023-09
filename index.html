            This campground is in Tampa, so it's around a 3 hour drive, but it is on my bucket list for the next camping trip I plan! I mean, who wouldn't want to camp right next to the beach! <strong>#FortDeSotoPark</strong>

            I've been here just to visit for a few hours, but there is also a campground at this state park, but appearantly there aren't any "quiet hours" at this campground, so you know that means there isn't a park ranger there to shut you up or tell you to be quiet. This is a double edged sword, so I'm not so sure if I would ever spend the night here. <strong>#BahiaHondaPark</strong>

            No joke, this is a campground on an island close to Tampa where you have to get a ferry to get to the island and spend the night. Sounds really interesting, but since you can only take what you can carry, you really have to think about what you're going to take! <strong>#CayoCostaPark</strong>
